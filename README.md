# Recite the Quran with Accurate Pronunciation in Sinhala

## Overview
This project aims to provide a tool for phonetic transliteration of the Quran into the Sinhala language, allowing users to read and recite the Quran with accurate pronunciation alongside the Arabic text. We utilize open-source data and resources for the Quran text, Tajweed annotations, and Sinhala transliteration. It also incorporates audio recitation synchronized with highlighted text to enhance the user experience.

## Features to Expect
- Display of Quranic verses in Arabic text with parallel phonetic transliteration in Sinhala.
- Integration of Tajweed annotations for accurate recitation guidance.
- Audio recitation playback with synchronized highlighting of the current verse being recited.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and usage.

## Usage
- Upon running the application, the Quranic verses will be displayed with Arabic text on one side and phonetic transliteration in Sinhala on the other side.
- Users can navigate through the verses, listen to audio recitation, and view Tajweed annotations for accurate recitation.
